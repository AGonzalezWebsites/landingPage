                <p class="goalsQuote">While I've always been facinated with technology as a whole, interest in this field came to me a bit later in life. Since then, I've been lost in idea that creating anything you want on the web is just a few (or many) keystrokes away.

                While I've focused primarily on front-end, I am very interested in (and have likely started while you're reading this) learning back-end. My goal is the be an asset to a company, and continue my pursuit in gaining knowledge to expand my toolset.</p>
